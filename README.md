Tornangular
===========
Tornado + AngularJS = pure Awesomeness™

[Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/) and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) are two fantastic web technologies – 
for the client and the server, respectively. They are both fast and lightweight, and can play nicely together. 
This is a simple starter kit to get you going; get up and running in no time:

Prerequisites
-------------

1. Python (2.7 or newer).
2. [Pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip)
3. Um, well, that's it really!

Get started
-----------

    git clone && cd tornangular
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python server.py
    # The server is now running at http://localhost:8888 – enjoy!
